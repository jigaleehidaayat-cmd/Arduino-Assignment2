# Arduino Assignment 2 — Beeping Countdown
This is my submission for Assignment 2 in the Programming C++ for Engineers Using Arduino course at [Your University].
## What this project does
A 7-segment display counts down from 9 to 0. On each step, a passive buzzer plays a short beep. When the countdown reaches 0, the buzzer plays a longer tone to signal completion.
## Hardware used
- Arduino Uno
- 1 x passive buzzer (piezo)
- 1 x single-digit 7-segment display (common cathode)
- 1 x 220 ohm resistor (on the COM pin)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
## Concepts demonstrated
- The tone() and noTone() functions
- Passive vs active buzzers
- 7-segment display wiring (common cathode)
- 2D arrays for digit patterns (lookup table)
- Functions with parameters
- while and for loops
- Serial Monitor output
 ## How to run it
  1. Wire the buzzer to pin 8.
  2. Wire the 7-segment segments a-g to Arduino pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9   (direct wires, no resistors).
  3. Connect the COM pin of the display to GND via a 220 ohm resistor.
  4. Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.
  5. Select Tools > Board > Arduino Uno and the correct Port.
  6. Click Upload.
